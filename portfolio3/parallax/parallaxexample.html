        <h2>All About Dorohedoro (ドロヘドロ)</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>Dorohedoro was first published in <i>Weekly Big Comic Spirits Special Edition IKKI</i>, which was published each other month as a supplement magazine to <i>Weekly Big Comic Spirits</i>, from late 2000 to early 2003. A successor magazine <i>Monthly Ikki</i> was then launched, replacing <i>Weekly Big Comic Spirits Special Edition IKKI</i>. Dorohedoro was moved there starting from <i>Monthly Ikki's</i> first April 2003 Issue. In 2014, it was announced that <i>Monthly Ikki</i> would be suspended with its last issue being the November 2014 issue, released on September 25, 2014. Some of the series, including Dorohedoro, was then moved to <i>Monthly Ikki's</i> successor magazine, <i>Hibana</i>, which launched on March 6, 2015, as a supplement magazine for Big Comic Spirits. Hibana ceased publication with its September 2017 issue, released on August 7, 2017. Dorohedoro was then moved to <i>Gekkan</i> monthly magazine starting from December 2017 issue, and remaining until its end in Gekkan's October 2018 issue.</p>
        <p>The story has been on several hiatuses. However, thanks to its cult manga status, the original ending was postponed to spawn four more volumes.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>Plot</h3>
        <p>The Hole is a dismal city where humans live in constant fear due to the sadistically disfiguring and often fatal abuse from the Magic Users, beings from another dimension closely resembling humans. In order to further their magic proficiency, they test their unique, gruesome abilities on the humans of The Hole. The Humans resent them, but have adapted to living in a society irreversibly affected by their interference, believing themselves to be totally at their mercy. However, Caiman, a man with a reptilian head and a bad case of amnesia, has taken to the streets brutally murdering sorcerers along with his partner Nikaido. The pair patrol the Hole, shoving the head of every sorcerer they find into Caiman’s mouth and asking them each the same simple question before putting them down: “What did the man inside say?”</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>Style</h3>
        <p><b>Backgrounds and Character Design</b></p>
        <p>One of the biggest appeals in the manga is its highly detailed scenarios. These backgrounds express the world's mood around the characters with as much as the character themselves because everything is hand-drawn. All the visuals show some sketch or rough lines, suiting the dirty and convoluted environment.</p>
        <p><b>Main Cast</b></p>
        <p>As much as the scenarios, the characters are designed in a wide variety of forms. One of the most suitable examples is Noi, with a design that goes from a brute gimp-looking bouncer to a beautiful muscular woman just with a change of clothes. Most of the characters are surreal or brutal in appearance, but with a charming and quite warming personality, showing them as normal, real people, but with rough exteriors.</p>
        <p>Their design is inspired by Motofumi Kobayashi's Omega series, King Gonta's Soten Koro, and even Puripuri-ken sense of humor. These mangas gave Q Hayashida her typical touch in design and character development, for example, Kaiman's militaristic-looking clothes and overall detailed weaponry come from Motofumi's work.</p>
